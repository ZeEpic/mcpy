## Minecraft Python

A new programming language based on Python, with Minecraft features built it. It's compiled to Java code, which can be viewed by the user.
It first turns the code into tokens using the lexer. Then, it combines tokens into syntax nodes. It combines the syntax nodes into identifiers, contexts, and translates it all to Java. Lastly, it compiles the Java into a jar.
You can use this jar as a plugin for your server!
