## Tips

### *Getting Started*
- Learn python
- If you don't know how to do something, assume it works the same as it does in python but replace a colon with `{ }`
- If it's something specific to Minecraft plugins, check this examples folder
- If you're still stuck, ask in the Discord
- Unlike python, adding tab spacing is not required!

### *Syntax*

- Use snake_case_for_everything
- Use `@` for locations
- Use `true` and `false` instead of `True` and `False`
- You don't need a return type on a function if it does not return anything
- Use `num` instead of `int` or `float`
- Types are required, unlike in python (i.e. `def function(arg: num)`)
- Many helpful code structures follow this format:
```
structure whatever_name(arguments) by someone {
    # code
}
```
